I love software. I love open source. I love learning.

These are the basics you need to know when reading this blog. It doesn't get any more complicated than that.

This blog is something I have been meaning to start for quite a while now. I believe I bring a somewhat interesting angle to the (burdgeoning) world of programming blogs. You see, I am a Product Manager, not a developer. More to the point, I don't make my living with code, but I do make my living in software.

For as long as I can remember, going WAAAY back to my first Vic20 in the early 80s, I have loved software and had a great appreciation for how it is crafted to solve problems, provide services, and entertain those who use it. I did attend a community college in Nova Scotia and learned COBOL, RPG, and Cognos PowerHouse. So I guess you can consider me a "trained" programmer. But in my 20+ years in the software industry, I have never been employed as a developer.

This as led to a somewhat different approach to projects I contribute to and code I write... I lack a certain discipline in that software development is a hobby to me and I have never had to sit myself down and bang out some code to pay the bills or make a deadline.

In addition, any technology I investigate, tool I use or language I explore is completely up to me. This is a freedom I enjoy as a hobbyist, casual developer. Actually, I would say I have more than a little *technology ADD* as I pick up and drop tools and technologies at will and without remorse. So if you read this blog  on a regular basis, it *might* not dive deeply into any one technology. If you're a details person, I apologize in advance ;)

I will write up a proper bio and put it in an **About** page soon, but for now, the main focus of this blog is to let people share in what catches my attention in the world of (mostly) open source and my experiences as a Casual Coder.
